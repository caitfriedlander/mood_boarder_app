## The Idea:
__Make Beautiful Mood Boards__

When doing any sort of design work, one common first step is to create mood boards- collections of images that evoke a theme, look, or mood, as the name might suggest, to help direct the visual design process.

Asside from Pinterest there are no really good mood board making sites out there so for my first full stack web app, I decided to make one.

## Development: 

#### Trello Planning:
https://trello.com/b/rcPoKUP6/mood-boarder

#### Languages:
* Ruby on Rails
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript (rails behind the scenes)

#### Frameworks:
* Bootstrap
* SASS (Included with Rails)
* jQuery (Included with Rails)

## Process/Retrospective
This was my fist try at a ful stack web app and I'm very proud of what I have achieved with it, though due to time constraints (I had a week to complete it) there were a lot of things that I either did not get to finish yet or just didn't get to finish to my standards.

The styling in particular is very lacking and I look forward to coming back and overhauling it.

#### Tables/Relationships
My database has the following tables:

Users Has many Boards
Board Has one User
Users Has many Likes
Users Has many Followers
Users Has many Followed Users
Board Has many Images

This was fairly easy to construct, the only complications arose when dealing with the followers/followed users table.

## Cleaning my code up:

#### Styling
I love styling and it's normally something that I take quite a lot of pride in. However, as this project was mostly about learning the back end, I put styling off til the last day and that shows. I will be completely overhauling everything before my next deployment.

#### Commenting
Due to the time constraints, I do not have adequate comments on this code. When I go back in I will be focusing on adding more comments to the whole app so that anyone else reading my code can unserstand my process.

## Styles

I went for a sort of organic, hipster corkboard-and chalkboard vibe as it fits the theme of this site quite well. Howver the styling is basic and boring and not as sophisticated as I would like by far.
